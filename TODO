* Make UI widget library
  * clearAllFocus() should hierarchically reset all focus to false.
  * need to have 'tab order' to walk through things the user can select?
  * Do we need actions like Button::onClick() ? Or should that just get managed manually?
  * Menu ?
  * Checkbox ?
  * Radio button ?

* Handle 40 MHz crosstalk on 5G
* Handle 40 MHz crosstalk on 2.4 GHz


  * 802.11a/g (2.4 GHz) spectral fall-off:
    chan dist     freq dist    power

    4             +/-20 Mhz      -28 dBm (x1/256 W pwr) (Considered non-interfering)
  * 802.11b (2.4 GHz) spectral fall-off:
    chan dist     freq dist    power
    1             +/- 5 MHz        0

* Main UI: Select a wifi channel > See a detail page.
  * Show SSID, BSSID, channel(s), freq.
  * See channel width (20/40 MHz)
  * See protocols (b/g/n) enabled
  * See 1d heatmap of channel interference
  * Btn to remove ssid from heatmaps

* Move BSSID out from main list and show b/g/n indicators?

* Pull out UIWidgets into a separate library.
