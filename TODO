* Make UI widget library
  * (ok) Panel (nestable/composable; no visible chrome by default; holds another elt)
    * (ok) Columns
  * (ok) VScroll Widget
    * (ok) Entry element
    * (ok) Scrollbar
  * (ok) Button
  * (ok) Text line
    * (ok) Str text line
    * (ok) Int text line
    * (ok) Float text line
  * (ok) All items can have border (square or rounded; viz on each side independently or full-around.)
  * (ok) All items can be shown inverted for focus
  * (ok) Add invalidateElem(UIWidget*) method to redraw only the components of the screen that
    get composited into the rect for that widget.
  * clearAllFocus() should hierarchically reset all focus to false.
  * need to have 'tab order' to walk through things the user can select?
  * Do we need actions like Button::onClick() ? Or should that just get managed manually?
  * Menu ?
  * Checkbox ?
  * Radio button ?


* Improvement: VScroll re-render should not clear/redraw the whole scroll-bar;
  it should just "un-draw" the current slider box and then add the new square.
  ... this would require a big refactor: the parent widgets would need to know to
  invalidate the narrower rect that contains the VScroll elements, not the scrollbar too.
  And the VScroll's own redrawChildWidget() would need to take different logic than just
  blindly invoking its own render().


  ... redrawChildWidget() should take an optional param that sends a hint to the widget
  being redrawn. Then we can do screen.redrawWidget(vscroll, SCROLL_DATA_AREA),
  screen.redrawWidget(vscroll, SCROLLBAR), etc.

  If the redraw args are non-zero, no parent backgrounds are drawn at all.

  - Every row of the zebra-stripe table needs its own explicit bg color
  - No top-screen BG color
  - VScroll needs a separate scrollbar_area_bg to redraw that area.

* Improvement: scrollUp() and scrollDown() should momentarily make the appropriate caret
  turn solid; they should also (be able to) manage the re-rendering.
  * alt: add methods to highlight the carets, and have the "click down" event in the button handler
    highlight the caret (and unhighlight it on release -- automatic given entire VScroll is
    currently redrawn).


* Add a BarChart widget that lets us show the histogram of signals on each freq, separate charts
  for 2.4G and 5Ghz.
  ... alt, make each histogram column a bunch of square blocks, one block per count, and have
  them be a heatmap indicating RSSI. (Stronger signals bright red, weaker signals fade to black.)

* Main UI
  * (ok) List all wifi channels in a scrollable thingie
  * (ok) Scroll thru the wifi channels
  * Select a wifi channel > See a detail page.
