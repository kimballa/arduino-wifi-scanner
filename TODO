* Make UI widget library
  * clearAllFocus() should hierarchically reset all focus to false.
  * need to have 'tab order' to walk through things the user can select?
  * Do we need actions like Button::onClick() ? Or should that just get managed manually?
  * Menu ?
  * Checkbox ?
  * Radio button ?

* Pull out UIWidgets into a separate library.
