* Make UI widget library
  * clearAllFocus() should hierarchically reset all focus to false.
  * need to have 'tab order' to walk through things the user can select?
  * Do we need actions like Button::onClick() ? Or should that just get managed manually?
  * Menu ?
  * Checkbox ?
  * Radio button ?

* Add a BarChart widget that lets us show the histogram of signals on each freq, separate charts
  for 2.4G and 5Ghz.
  ... alt, make each histogram column a bunch of square blocks, one block per count, and have
  them be a heatmap indicating RSSI. (Stronger signals bright red, weaker signals fade to black.)

  * 802.11a/g (2.4 GHz) spectral fall-off: 
    chan dist     freq dist    power
    1             +/- 5 MHz        0
    2             +/-10 MHz      -15 dBm (x1/32 Watts pwr)
    3             +/-15 MHz      -25 dBm (x1/128 W pwr)
    4             +/-20 Mhz      -28 dBm (x1/256 W pwr) (Considered non-interfering) 
  * 802.11b (2.4 GHz) spectral fall-off:
    chan dist     freq dist    power
    1             +/- 5 MHz        0
    2             +/-10 MHz        0 dBm 
    3             +/-15 MHz      -30 dBm (x1/512 W pwr)
    4             +/-20 Mhz      -50 dBm (Non-interfering) 

* Main UI
  * (ok) List all wifi channels in a scrollable thingie
  * (ok) Scroll thru the wifi channels
  * Select a wifi channel > See a detail page.


* Pull out UIWidgets into a separate library.
